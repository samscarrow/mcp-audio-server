# MCP Audio Server Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the MCP Audio Server architecture.

## System Overview

The MCP Audio Server is a modular service that analyzes audio files to extract musical features such as chords, key, and tempo. It exposes a REST API that accepts audio data and returns structured analysis results.

## Request Flow

```
Client -> FastAPI Server -> Audio Decoder -> Analysis Modules -> Caching -> Response
```

1. **Client** submits a request with base64-encoded audio data
2. **FastAPI Server** validates the request and generates a correlation ID
3. **Audio Decoder** processes the audio file using FFmpeg
4. **Analysis Modules** extract musical features from the audio
5. **Caching** stores results for future requests
6. **Response** is validated against a JSON schema and returned to client

## Key Components

### API Layer

- Built with FastAPI
- Input validation using JSON Schema
- Response validation using JSON Schema
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Standardized error responses

### Audio Processing

- FFmpeg-based audio decoding
- Audio normalization (mono, 44.1kHz)
- Format validation
- Resource limits and timeouts

### Analysis Modules

- Pluggable architecture with registry pattern
- Modules for chord detection, key detection, tempo tracking
- Basic and advanced implementations for each module
- Configurable through request options

### Concurrency and Performance

- Process pool for CPU-bound operations
- Resource limits for memory and CPU
- Request timeouts and cancellation
- Request queueing with configurable limits

### Caching

- Two-tiered caching (Redis + filesystem)
- Input hashing for deterministic cache keys
- TTL-based expiration
- LRU eviction for disk space management

### Observability

- Prometheus metrics
- Structured logging with JSON format
- Health and readiness endpoints
- Performance tracking and benchmarking

## Security

- Runs as non-root user
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure temporary file handling
- Resource limits and isolation
- Attack surface minimization

## Deployment Model

The server is packaged as a Docker container with:

- Multi-stage build for minimal image size
- Unprivileged user
- Optional GPU support
- Support for scaling with orchestration platforms
- Docker Compose configuration for development

## Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal scaling for increased throughput
- Shared caching layer for efficiency
- Resource throttling to prevent overload
- Health checks for orchestration readiness
